We don't need ui testing or network based testing.
Never disable github workflows unless specified.

## Code Structure & Ordering

To maintain consistency and reduce merge conflicts, please follow this ordering for class members in `.cpp` files:

1.  **Includes** (grouped by library/module)
2.  **Constants / Static Helpers**
3.  **Constructor / Destructor**
4.  **Public Methods**
5.  **Slots** (grouped by functionality: Tray, List, Toolbar, etc.)
6.  **Private Helpers** (Setup, Logic)

In header files (`.h`), group declarations similarly and use comments to separate sections.

## Never Nest Principle

Avoid deep nesting of `if/else` blocks. Use guard clauses (early returns) to handle edge cases and error conditions first. This makes the "happy path" of the function less indented and easier to read.

## Function Size & Complexity

Break down large functions into smaller, single-purpose helper functions. This improves readability and makes the code easier to test and maintain.

## Building and Compiling (Qt6 / KF6 Migration)
This project is currently migrating to Qt6 and KDE Frameworks 6 (KF6).
If your environment does not have the required Qt6 or KF6 development headers, there is a Dockerfile located in `.jules/Dockerfile` that can be used to set up an isolated build container (e.g. `debian:testing`) with all required `libkf6*` dependencies.


## GitHub Personal Access Tokens (PATs)
When token requirements change for API endpoints (Classic vs. Fine-grained scopes), update the corresponding hints in the UI (e.g., SettingsDialog, NewIssueDialog) and documentation (README.md) to reflect the new requirements.
